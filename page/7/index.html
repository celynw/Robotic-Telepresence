      <p>I naïvely thought that if I rotate the object so that regardless of <em>which</em> axis is which, that all three from the <code>urdf</code> line up with those in Unity, I could then just swap them out with each other and everything would work.<br>However, this doesn’t seem to work. Maybe it’s something to do with Unity doing rotation in Z, then X, then Y according to the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-eulerAngles.html" target="_blank" rel="external">docs</a>, whereas ROS does X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>This was a headache until I realised that instead of using the <code>transform.localEulerAngles</code>, I can use <code>transform.Rotate</code>.<br>Rather than setting the rotation it can apply one in a single axis.<br>Changing the order of rotations in a script <em>does</em> change the result, as one might expect.<br>However, there’s no combination of rotations with 100 degrees and 90 degrees which would place the screen in the correct location!</p>
<p>Much later - I’ve worked it out!<br>I’ve been presuming that every link definition has an origin rotation of zero.<br>This is true for all cases <em>except</em> the screen (which is a child of head_nod).<br>I think this is unique because this has display as a child which will need to be the correct way up in the simulator. D’oh!<br>I still haven’t worked out the correct rotation combinations for the script, another time.</p>

  <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
    
      <p>I’ve managed to get the Baxter meshes into Unity, but they are completely separate parts.<br>ROS uses a <code>.urdf</code> file format to relate parts to each other, which isn’t directly compatible or convertible to a Unity supported format.<br>In order to progress, I need to manually rig Baxter.<br>I can view the official files as they are text-based (an <code>xml</code> format).<br>Within the <code>baxter.urdf</code> file, there is a header:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">baxter.urdf is DEPRECATED. It is included here for backward compatibility.</div><div class="line">Please use baxter.urdf.xacro by running:</div><div class="line">$ rosrun xacro xacro.py - -inorder `rospack find baxter_description`/urdf/baxter.urdf.xacro</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The <code>xacro</code> format also is <code>xml</code> based.<br>It seems to be the same, but also include metadata for the materials.<br>I’ll be using this <code>.urdf.xacro</code> file for reference and ignoring the <code>.urdf</code>.</p>
<p>I started with the torso, as that was described in the <code>baxter_base.urdf.xacro</code> as being at the origin.<br><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/27/Rigging-Baxter/Torso.png" alt=""><br>I am thinking of adding the collision models later when(/if) I need to.<br>There are two files in the head folder, <code>H0</code> and <code>H1</code>. The <code>urdf</code> describes <code>H1</code> being called the ‘screen’.<br>By looking at photos of a fully assembled Baxter, <code>H1</code> is a round part which appears to attach below the head part of the torso model, and the screen should attach to that.<br>Unfortunately, the coordinates in the <code>urdf</code> do not match the coordinate system in Unity.</p>
<ul>
<li>An decrease in <code>Z</code> in the <code>urdf</code> is an increase in <code>Y</code> in Unity.</li>
<li>The units in the <code>urdf</code> appear to be almost 100x smaller than those in Unity.<br>Even manually moving the <code>H0</code> part to the correct Y location, it is still offset, even though the <code>urdf</code> describes the other axes as being zero.<br><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/27/Rigging-Baxter/Offset.png" alt="Showing the strange offset"></li>
</ul>
<p>I also noticed that the screen (<code>H1</code>) was rotated 90 degrees. The <code>urdf</code> describes the rotation in radians, while Unity describes it in degrees.</p>
<p>Looking at a <code>urdf</code> <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch" target="_blank" rel="external">tutorial</a>, ROS uses metres as the units of distance.<br>Unity uses generic units, but in relation to the scale of the model parts this looks about correct.</p>
<p>After writing half an email to Oscar, I worked it out.<br>I had a better look at the <code>urdf</code> and noticed that the <code>&quot;head&quot;</code> link is mentioned in some <code>joint</code> objects.<br>Specifically, the <code>&quot;head_pan&quot;</code> joint with the parent of <code>&quot;torso&quot;</code> and the child of <code>&quot;head&quot;</code> had the correct coordinates (some inverted and not the correct xyz).<br>The <code>urdf</code> is heirarchical, with inherited transformations.<br>Unity also works like this, so I can lay out Unity GameObjects in the same manner as in the <code>urdf</code>. Duh.<br>Perhaps the origin values in the links themselves could be the internal origins in the <code>.dae</code> files?</p>
<p>I started off with the parent-most object: the <code>base</code>. Everything inherits from here.<br>As I went along, GameObjects were made for joints, links, parents, children… I started assigning Unity tags to them to remember what was what, keeping their original names.<br>The <code>head_camera</code> joint has a child link called <code>head_camera</code>, so GameObjects like these need to be separate.<br>As I was going through, it became obvious that going down the hierarchy, it alternates between joint and link.<br>Imay have to specify between <code>&quot;fixed&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;revolute&quot;</code> joint types.<br>To save myself some work, I copied the right arm to the left once I’d created all of the GameObjects.<br>There will still be a good amount of work to input all of the coordinates.<br>I think this is necessary, even if I do end up making a converter, so that I understand it and I know it works.<br>When dragging the models in, these should replace the relevant “URDF link” tagged GameObjects.</p>
<p>I dragged in the torso, pedestal, head mount and screen.<br>The screen has some rotation which I need to work out.</p>
<p>I can’t work out the rotation for the screen (<code>head_nod</code>), so I’ll continue adding parts for now.<br>Is the origin of each model as described in the <code>urdf</code> the origin in the DAE file? Does Unity see this?<br>If so, undoing that in the parent GameObject will be good?<br>By comparing the <code>left_torso_arm_mount</code> and the <code>right_torso_arm_mount</code>, we can see which numbers are mirrored, and so which correspond to what?</p>
<p>I talked with a housemate who worked with Unity on placement.<br>When you drag a <code>.DAE</code> into Unity, it creates a new GameObject, which contains 3 children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Lamp</li>
<li>Mesh (with the same name as the GameObject)</li>
</ul>
<p>He pointed out that the Camera and Lamp are not created by Unity, but exported from whatever was used to design the models (Blender/3DS Max).</p>
<p>Changing a GameObject’s parent does not move the object in the scene. As a result, a transformation is applied to counteract the change the parent’s transformation has on this GameObject.<br>I didn’t realise this until I messed up the values everywhere. Correcting…</p>
<p>I got pretty confused with the combined rotations for the screen, so I’m going to try doing the arms.<br>Some of the transformations don’t seem to make sense. The part can be perfectly in place but have one transformation still to do.<br>I think the rotations are being done in the wrong order.</p>
<p>I found somebody trying to do exactly what I am, <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/problem-with-setting-game-object-rotation.426902/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, but their problem is related to gimbal lock with eurler angles.</p>
<h4 id="Looking-at-an-example"><a href="#Looking-at-an-example" class="headerlink" title="Looking at an example"></a>Looking at an example</h4><p>If I could get <code>Gazebo</code> to work in a virtual machine, I can see what baxter looks like at time=0 on one monitor, and have Unity on the other.<br>I had some problems getting it to run.<br>The problems were caused by VirtualBox Additions, for shared folders/clipboard, resolution fixes etc.<br>However I still can’t get it to run. I think there’s some incompatibility between ROS Kinetic and Indigo.<br>(The <a href="http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_Simulator" target="_blank" rel="external">website</a> only gives support for up to Indigo).<br>I’ve also found that Indigo isn’t supported on Ubuntu 16! Only <a href="http://answers.ros.org/question/240718/installing-indigo-after-kinetic" target="_blank" rel="external">13 and 14</a>.</p>
<p>I created a new virtual machine, and I seemed to get close to it working, but it started quitting with no error feedback,</p>

      <p>After some research I’ve found a possibly good solution.<br>Currently I’m keeping my notes as markdown on a USB stick under source control (Mercurial).<br>If I push them to my bitbucket repository, they can be hosted under the URL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>USERNAME</strong>.bitbucket.io</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page can host anything static. No PHP, but you can do a lot with JS and CSS.<br>Set up the <code>Aerobatic</code> BitBucket plugin. It’s supposed to support jekyll, so that I can just push new Markdown to the repo and it will rebuild the site for me.</p>
<p>I’ve got jekyll to work, however I’ve found out that the Aerobatic plugin for BitBucket only has 5 publishes per 24 hours.<br>I’m going to see if I can run it locally to preview before pushing, but this could be a dealbreaker.<br>I’ve got jekyll to work locally.<br>I can’t get the automatic updating when a file is edited to work, but it doesn’t matter so much.</p>
<p>Currently my notes are one big markdown file, I’m going to split them into individual posts.</p>
<p>I’ve run into some problems with the index page.<br>Aerobatic couldn’t find the index.html.<br>It’s not in the jekyll folder in the repo, I assumed everything would be OK seeing as though it served locally well.<br>It turns out the problem was that local Jekyll was using <code>index.md</code>, and Aerobatic was <em>specifically</em> looking for <code>index.html</code></p>
<p>Aerobatic won’t populate the index.html either, it needs to work on <code>.md</code> files. Hmm. Will sort it out another time.</p>

<h4 id="Baxter-models"><a href="#Baxter-models" class="headerlink" title="Baxter models"></a>Baxter models</h4><p>There’s <a href="http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/URDF" target="_blank" rel="external">an official page</a> for Baxter’s URDF.<br>I will try to see how easy it is to input its information into Unity.<br>There’s also a <a href="https://github.com/RethinkRobotics" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub page</a> for ReThink Robotics Inc. (Baxter).<br>Some of the meshes can be found there:<br><figure class="highlight zsh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ git <span class="built_in">clone</span> https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_common</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Each body part is provided as a Collada <code>.dae</code> format.<br>Even the collision bounds models are included.<br>They can be dragged straight into Unity.<br><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/23/Robot-models/Models.png" alt="Showing the torso and some random arm parts"><br>The lighting and shading is immediately higher quality than that in the simulator, Gazebo:</p>
<p><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/23/Robot-models/Gazebo.png" alt="This was taken from the web as an example."><br>A Google search yields a URDF to Unity GameObject converter, <a href="https://github.com/MangoMangoDevelopment/neptune/wiki/Importing-and-Displaying-URDF-file" target="_blank" rel="external">neptune</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our system will be able to detect when you’re importing a URDF and create a corresponding Unity GameObject to represent the robot/sensor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will save time and maintain compatibility, rather than assembling the complete model myself.<br>Part of the <code>neptune</code> git clone seems to be a Unity project, so I’ve imported it and upgraded it to version 5.5.<br>It seems like I will have to use Visual Studio on Windows to compile the conversion utility, as Unity is expected to be running on Windows.</p>
<p>I managed to compile them, but I’m not sure how to use them. I am left with a <code>.dll</code> file in the ‘Debug’ directory.<br>It doesn’t help that the GitHub project is mostly private.</p>
<p>I looked up if you could get Gazebo running in Windows.<br>The <a href="http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_windows&amp;cat=install" target="_blank" rel="external">site</a> says you can and gives instructions, but it’s easy to miss this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not actually work yet.</p>
