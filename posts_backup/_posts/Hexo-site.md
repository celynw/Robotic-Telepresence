There has been a lot of trial and error (mostly error) with BitBucket, Aerobatic, Jekyll, GitHub, zsh, ssh keys etc. etc.
Finally, [hexo](https://hexo.io/) looks like the solution I was looking for.
I'm still yet to edit the site layout, css, hexo configuration, but I can now post my notes.
It doesn't support mercurial, but the GitHub hosting is much better than that of BitBucket.
