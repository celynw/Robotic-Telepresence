#### Project progress
I'm still not sure why I had so much trouble converting 3D-space points back into floats.
However, there should be a library in `ROS` for PCL, which is what I should be using after all.

#### Interim report plan feedback
I received some feedback about the structure of the report.
I should think about it more logically, and get somebody else to read it.
I'll also be including multiple revisions of Gantt charts, including an 
up-to-date version.
