#### Safety
Apparently ROS has a way to set initial constraints, so that for instance, commands which tell him to move his hands into the space occupied by the table can be overridden.
While Baxter tends to avoid collisions with his other arms and the torso, apparently he ignores the screen on the head, so I'll have to be careful of that.
If I'm going to be in VR in the robot lab, I'll need another person to be in the room at the same time. It would be possible to start with to just not wear the headset and view the game windows on a monitor.

#### Next steps
Soon, another PC will be set up in the robot lab able to run Windows, then I can get started on practical development.
I still need to learn to use Baxter, but the environment should be set up for this already.
