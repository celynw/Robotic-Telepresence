I ran the new code and project in the robot lab.
I appears that the jerky motion exhibited by the `rosbag` was related to the recording.
The computer running `roscore` connected to baxter is not connected directly to the Unity PC, but they are in the same network.
As there are no problems detected so far, the URDF data contained in Baxter matches the URDF file in the Unity project.
