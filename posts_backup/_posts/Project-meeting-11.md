The focus of the meeting was the midterm report.
Main points which came up were:
- I put content in the abstract which, if anywhere, should have been in the introduction
- I should always have text between subsequent headings/subheadings
- I shouldn't often go below X.X subsections. Most of the writing was in X.X.X.
- I need to make things extremely clear
  - My aim
  - My objectives
  - The work I've done
- I fell into the chronological order trap. I should structure it from broad to more specific
- The same goes for supporting diagrams

I also need to come up with some ways to test the resulting applications.
- Qualitative results
  - Screenshots
  - Video (viva)
  - Demonstration
- Quantitative results
  - Numerical testing values
    - Latency?
    - Throughput?
    - etc.
  I can obtain some of these by doing user tests and asking them to complete a survey afterwards.

With regards to the background literature, I'l need much more for the final report.
Report reviews are very helpful.
~~Steal~~ Reference the results they already have.

I'll be using LaTeX to write the final thing.
