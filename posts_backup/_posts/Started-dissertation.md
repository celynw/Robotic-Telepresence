I am using [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/). The free features are great. I'm only missing git synchronisation, but I can still do it manually.
I found the [Computer Science department's template](https://github.com/themasterchef/computing-project-report-template) which I can modify to suit my course.
By the next project meeting I will have a preliminary structure.
