### Housekeeping
- I haven't filled out the project health and safety form. Bring it to the next meeting!
- I'm required to take notes. I should also keep them in a format which Rich can read
	In the past people have used Google Docs. I like the idea of keeping my notes in Markdown so I might end up using an online host for that.
- When will I have something shiny to show?
	I've made a Gantt chart, but I didn't bring it.
	I may need to change it over the next few weeks as well
	If I'm taking screenshots and hosting my notes, it will be easier to write my midterm/final report.
- Poke Oscar about giving me some point cloud data.
