#### Things discussed
- Feedback from midterm report
- Tips for the midterm interview tomorrow
- The existing problem with point clouds

The point clouds might be getting stuck due to the sheer size of the point cloud frames.
If so, then cutting the resolution down could save a lot of time and processing.
I could test some example (smaller) clouds.
However, I'd expect some response from the socket node or some network activity.

It also could be down to the type of data, as it's the only topic of its kind.

At this point, it was suggested that it might be better to directly connect the Kinect to the VR computer.
I've demonstrated some functionality for a framework for viewing ROS clouds.
It would free up time for working on other aspects and could be relatively straight-forward to implement and achieve good results.
