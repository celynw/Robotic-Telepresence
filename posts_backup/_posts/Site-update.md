I've inserted Gantt chart using a navbar link.
I tried doing an iframe in a page, but I couldn't modify the `.styl` and `.ejs` theme files to make the post wide enough to view the chart properly.

I can update it through the page because of my cookies, but other people can only view.
It keeps up to date, so I can fill out the progess/overhaul it when I throw it out of the window.

I've also enhanced the code blocks, quote blocks, margins and header.
