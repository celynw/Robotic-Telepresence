I now have access to a PC in the robot lab.
It's almost ready to go, I still need local network access so that ROS data can be communicated.
The first thing I want to try is the joint angles, but it would be great to get the point cloud data as well.
In the mean time, I'll be looking into generating the commands for moving Baxter, and setting restrictions on movement from within the Unity project.
