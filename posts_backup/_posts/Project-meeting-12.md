The development and issues with point clouds were discussed.
It may be possible to transmit a depth image over ROS rather than a point cloud.
If I can get the live depth image into a point cloud on the Unity client, I may be able to swap in the ROS message.

However, the focus now is on getting the simple control and feedback finished, so I will be forgetting abou point clouds for now.
I hope to have this part near complete over this week.
