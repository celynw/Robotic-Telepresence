#### Main things to take away
I need to really be sure on what it is I'm trying to acheive. This should come across very clearly in the final report.
Rather than setting my work out in the order I discovered things (chronologically), it would be clearer if I start with broad information, and reading further qould increase the detail.

I need to finish the project as soon as possible, to any degree of quality. Then I should work on fleshing it out.
Even though I work regularly there's a risk of not finishing, which could severely limit the available marks.
I'll be working on control for Baxter and implementing VR over the next couple of weeks.
