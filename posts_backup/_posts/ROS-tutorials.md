I'm going to do the ROS tutorials and get to grips with some of the terminology and terms.
I think the best method of approach now is to actually use Windows for development.

I did most of the tutorials with the turtle.
I've installed ROS on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS on my Raspberry Pi 2B.
Following meeting with Bowden, I've decided to publish my notes so he can read them remotely.
He said specifically he's not going to pore them.
There was no preference for Google Drive or OneDrive.
In the end, I decided to stick with Markdown.
