It turns out that the [Gazebo Simulator](http://gazebosim.org/) supports [Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=oculus)!
I still can't get this to work with the Vive (yet) unless I use Gazebo under Windows, and even then...
As far as I can tell, it just acts as a [navigator](https://github.com/MohitShridhar/oculus_gazebo_navigator).
Although this is here, I still think it would be easier and possibly more useful to continue with Unity for now.

As it's already installed, I check out Gazebo, and the shading isn't awful:
