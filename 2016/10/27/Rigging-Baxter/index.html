      <p>I’ve managed to get the Baxter meshes into Unity, but they are completely separate parts.<br>ROS uses a <code>.urdf</code> file format to relate parts to each other, which isn’t directly compatible or convertible to a Unity supported format.<br>In order to progress, I need to manually rig Baxter.<br>I can view the official files as they are text-based (an <code>xml</code> format).<br>Within the <code>baxter.urdf</code> file, there is a header:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">baxter.urdf is DEPRECATED. It is included here for backward compatibility.</div><div class="line">Please use baxter.urdf.xacro by running:</div><div class="line">$ rosrun xacro xacro.py - -inorder `rospack find baxter_description`/urdf/baxter.urdf.xacro</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The <code>xacro</code> format also is <code>xml</code> based.<br>It seems to be the same, but also include metadata for the materials.<br>I’ll be using this <code>.urdf.xacro</code> file for reference and ignoring the <code>.urdf</code>.</p>
<p>I started with the torso, as that was described in the <code>baxter_base.urdf.xacro</code> as being at the origin.<br><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/27/Rigging-Baxter/Torso.png" alt=""><br>I am thinking of adding the collision models later when(/if) I need to.<br>There are two files in the head folder, <code>H0</code> and <code>H1</code>. The <code>urdf</code> describes <code>H1</code> being called the ‘screen’.<br>By looking at photos of a fully assembled Baxter, <code>H1</code> is a round part which appears to attach below the head part of the torso model, and the screen should attach to that.<br>Unfortunately, the coordinates in the <code>urdf</code> do not match the coordinate system in Unity.</p>
<ul>
<li>An decrease in <code>Z</code> in the <code>urdf</code> is an increase in <code>Y</code> in Unity.</li>
<li>The units in the <code>urdf</code> appear to be almost 100x smaller than those in Unity.<br>Even manually moving the <code>H0</code> part to the correct Y location, it is still offset, even though the <code>urdf</code> describes the other axes as being zero.<br><img src="/Robotic-Telepresence/2016/10/27/Rigging-Baxter/Offset.png" alt="Showing the strange offset"></li>
</ul>
<p>I also noticed that the screen (<code>H1</code>) was rotated 90 degrees. The <code>urdf</code> describes the rotation in radians, while Unity describes it in degrees.</p>
<p>Looking at a <code>urdf</code> <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch" target="_blank" rel="external">tutorial</a>, ROS uses metres as the units of distance.<br>Unity uses generic units, but in relation to the scale of the model parts this looks about correct.</p>
<p>After writing half an email to Oscar, I worked it out.<br>I had a better look at the <code>urdf</code> and noticed that the <code>&quot;head&quot;</code> link is mentioned in some <code>joint</code> objects.<br>Specifically, the <code>&quot;head_pan&quot;</code> joint with the parent of <code>&quot;torso&quot;</code> and the child of <code>&quot;head&quot;</code> had the correct coordinates (some inverted and not the correct xyz).<br>The <code>urdf</code> is heirarchical, with inherited transformations.<br>Unity also works like this, so I can lay out Unity GameObjects in the same manner as in the <code>urdf</code>. Duh.<br>Perhaps the origin values in the links themselves could be the internal origins in the <code>.dae</code> files?</p>
<p>I started off with the parent-most object: the <code>base</code>. Everything inherits from here.<br>As I went along, GameObjects were made for joints, links, parents, children… I started assigning Unity tags to them to remember what was what, keeping their original names.<br>The <code>head_camera</code> joint has a child link called <code>head_camera</code>, so GameObjects like these need to be separate.<br>As I was going through, it became obvious that going down the hierarchy, it alternates between joint and link.<br>Imay have to specify between <code>&quot;fixed&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;revolute&quot;</code> joint types.<br>To save myself some work, I copied the right arm to the left once I’d created all of the GameObjects.<br>There will still be a good amount of work to input all of the coordinates.<br>I think this is necessary, even if I do end up making a converter, so that I understand it and I know it works.<br>When dragging the models in, these should replace the relevant “URDF link” tagged GameObjects.</p>
<p>I dragged in the torso, pedestal, head mount and screen.<br>The screen has some rotation which I need to work out.</p>
<p>I can’t work out the rotation for the screen (<code>head_nod</code>), so I’ll continue adding parts for now.<br>Is the origin of each model as described in the <code>urdf</code> the origin in the DAE file? Does Unity see this?<br>If so, undoing that in the parent GameObject will be good?<br>By comparing the <code>left_torso_arm_mount</code> and the <code>right_torso_arm_mount</code>, we can see which numbers are mirrored, and so which correspond to what?</p>
<p>I talked with a housemate who worked with Unity on placement.<br>When you drag a <code>.DAE</code> into Unity, it creates a new GameObject, which contains 3 children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Lamp</li>
<li>Mesh (with the same name as the GameObject)</li>
</ul>
<p>He pointed out that the Camera and Lamp are not created by Unity, but exported from whatever was used to design the models (Blender/3DS Max).</p>
<p>Changing a GameObject’s parent does not move the object in the scene. As a result, a transformation is applied to counteract the change the parent’s transformation has on this GameObject.<br>I didn’t realise this until I messed up the values everywhere. Correcting…</p>
<p>I got pretty confused with the combined rotations for the screen, so I’m going to try doing the arms.<br>Some of the transformations don’t seem to make sense. The part can be perfectly in place but have one transformation still to do.<br>I think the rotations are being done in the wrong order.</p>
<p>I found somebody trying to do exactly what I am, <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/problem-with-setting-game-object-rotation.426902/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, but their problem is related to gimbal lock with eurler angles.</p>
<h4 id="Looking-at-an-example"><a href="#Looking-at-an-example" class="headerlink" title="Looking at an example"></a>Looking at an example</h4><p>If I could get <code>Gazebo</code> to work in a virtual machine, I can see what baxter looks like at time=0 on one monitor, and have Unity on the other.<br>I had some problems getting it to run.<br>The problems were caused by VirtualBox Additions, for shared folders/clipboard, resolution fixes etc.<br>However I still can’t get it to run. I think there’s some incompatibility between ROS Kinetic and Indigo.<br>(The <a href="http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_Simulator" target="_blank" rel="external">website</a> only gives support for up to Indigo).<br>I’ve also found that Indigo isn’t supported on Ubuntu 16! Only <a href="http://answers.ros.org/question/240718/installing-indigo-after-kinetic" target="_blank" rel="external">13 and 14</a>.</p>
<p>I created a new virtual machine, and I seemed to get close to it working, but it started quitting with no error feedback,</p>
